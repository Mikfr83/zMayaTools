<h1>zFileSwitch</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

zFileSwitch allows specifying separate low- and high-resolution paths for a texture.
The low-res one can be used in the viewport, to reduce memory usage and scene load
times, and the high-res one can be used in renders.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Create a zFileSwitch node.  Connect its output attribute to your file node's
fileTextureName attribute.
<p>
In the attribute editor, set the high-res and low-res texture paths.  Note that
if one doesn't exist, the other will be used automatically.
<p>
Toggle <b>Use High Res</b> to switch the current texture.  To do this automatically,
create a render setup.  Right-click the render setup layer and select <b>Import User
Templates &gt; zFileSwitch</b>.  This will import settings to set Use High Res
only during renders.
<p>
Click <b>Refresh</b> to reload the selected texture.

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
    <b>output</b> - The currently selected path.  This should be connected to the
    fileTextureName attribute of a file node.
</li>
<li>
    <b>highResolution</b> - A path to the high-resolution texture.
</li>
<li>
    <b>lowResolution</b> - A path to the low-resolution texture.
</li>
<li>
    <b>useHighRes</b> - If set, the high-res texture will be used.  Otherwise, the low-res one
    will be used.
</li>
<li>
    <b>override</b> - If set to "Off", useHighRes will be used normally.  If "Force high-res"
    or "Force low-res" is selected, the given texture will be used, ignoring useHighRes.  This
    allows switching to one of the two textures without disconnecting useHighRes.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        File textures can't reload their textures if their path attribute is connected.
        This is a bug in the file node, not zFileSwitch.  Use Refresh in the zFileSwitch
        attribute editor instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Not all rendering features handle render setup local render overrides.  If this
        isn't supported, the render setup won't switch off the viewport override.  Render
        Sequence does support this.  You can also use a separate render setup for rendering
        if needed.
    </li>
</ul>
