<h2>Introduction</h2>
This provides a UI for editing Maya pick walk controllers.
<p>
Maya controllers allow configuring pick walking, which allows quickly navigating between
rig controllers even when they're in different DAG hierarchies or have helper groups between
them.
<p>
Controllers are a built-in feature of Maya.  This simply provides a UI to manipulate them.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Select <b>Control &gt; Edit Controllers</b> from the Rigging menu set.
<p>
Select a node and click <b>Create</b> to tag that object as a controller.
<p>
Controllers can be dragged underneath other controllers and reordered within
their parent.  Pick walking with the keyboard arrow keys navigates between
objects according to this hierarchy.
<p>
Click <b>Group</b> to create an empty controller with no object.  This can
be used as a root control to allow left/right pick walking between controls
that have no actual shared parent control.
