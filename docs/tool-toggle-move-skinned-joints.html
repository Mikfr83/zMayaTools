<p>
Move skinned joints.
<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Maya's built-in "Move Skinned Joints" mode only provides a move tool, so it can't be used to
rotate joints.
<p>
"Toggle Move Skinned Joints" allows using any manipulator, and remains active
until disabled, allowing joints to be rotated and edited freely.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Select <b>Skin &gt; Toggle Move Skinned Joints</b> from the Rigging menu set.
"Move skinned joints mode active" will appear in the HUD.
<p>
Joints can now be moved and rotated freely to adjust their bind position.  When
finished, toggle it back off.
