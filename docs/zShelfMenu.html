Show Maya shelves as menus.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Maya shelves are handy, but they quickly become unmanagable, since they can only show 6-letter labels.
This plugin shows shelves as Maya menus.
<p>
By default, a "Shelves" menu item will be added, which contains a submenu for each shelf.
The full name of each shelf button is used, so you can use descriptive names for each menu
item.
<p>
Selecting "Show on shelf" at the bottom of any shelf menu will add the menu directly to the
main menu to make it quick to select.
<p>
The options box on each shelf item will open it in the shelf editor for quick editing.
<p>
Shelf menus can be torn off like other menus, and shelf popup menus will be displayed in submenus.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Just enable the zShelfMenu plugin in Plug-in Manager.

<h2>Notes</h2>

Shelf scripts won't be printed to the script console each time they're run, like they are
when a shelf button is clicked.  This reduces output clutter.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        If a shelf item has both a script and popups, only the popups will be available.  Maya
        menus can't have both.
    </li>
    <li>
        Torn-off shelf menus won't automatically update if the shelf is modified, since Maya doesn't
        give any way to detect this.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the name of a shelf is changed, it will be lost from the list to show as a top-level
        menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a submenu of the Shelves menu is torn off, it'll disappear if the Shelves menu is opened.
        This is a Maya limitation and affects built-in menus as well, like Deform submenus.  It doesn't
        affect top-level menus.
    </li>
    <li>
        Python code will be called with an empty environment.  Shelves are normally executed in a shared
        global environment, but I'm not sure how to get access to it.  (This is messy: it means shelf
        scripts with missing imports will work if they're used after a script that imports it, but not
        if you use it first, so it's best to fix these anyway.)
    </li>
<ul>
