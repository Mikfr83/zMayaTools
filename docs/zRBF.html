An RBF solver for Maya.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are a few of these, but they're all either commercial, under restrictive
licenses, or native C++ plugins.  This plugin is rough, with no UI and only simple
vector-to-scalar support, but it's simple, permissively licensed, and written in
Python to simplify installation.
<p>
Some other implementations are here.  I haven't tried any of these:

</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

Being written in Python is convenient and not a performance problem when used for
things like high-level rigging, but its performance wouldn't be suitable for things like
calculating textures or dense particle systems.
