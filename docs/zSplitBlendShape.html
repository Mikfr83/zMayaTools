<h1>zSplitBlendShape</h1>

Split facial blend shapes into blended left and right halves

<h2>Usage</h2>

Select "Split blend shape" from Deform &gt; Edit Blend Shape.  The following options are available:

<ul>
    <li>
        "Blend shape" Select the blend shape containing the target you want to split.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Blend target" The blend shape target to split.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Blend distance" Select the distance to blend the split.  If 0, the halves will
        be cut sharply along the plane.  If 10, the halves will blend from one to the
        other for 10 units around the plane.  The default of 2 is good for typical faces
        when in standard Maya units, giving a 2cm blend.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Plane" Select the plane of symmetry.  The default of YZ is correct for Maya's
        default Y-up.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Plane origin" Set the origin for the plane of symmetry.  If "Plane" is set to
        YZ and "Plane origin" is set to 10, the blend shape will be split across a YZ
        plane with X = 10.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>This doesn't undo properly.  For now, just delete the new blend shapes.</li>
    <li>Menu settings aren't saved anywhere.  There are only two settings, so this isn't
    a big deal.</li>
</ul>
