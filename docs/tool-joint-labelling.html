</h1>

This allows quickly assigning joint sides, incremental "other" joint
labels, and a more logical ordering than the "Add Joint Labels" menu
to make it easier to quickly find each joint.

This is also much faster than labelling with a menu tearoff, since pick
walking can be used to move from joint to joint (arrow keys with a tearoff
menu will just navigate the menu).

<h2>Usage</h2>

Select joints an click to assign joint labels.
<p>
To assign other labels, enter a label in the text field and click "Set" (or press
enter).
<p>
Numbered labels can be set by entering a label ending in "#".  For example, select
your three spine joints, enter "Spine#", and the joints will be labelled Spine1,
Spine2 and Spine3 in the order they were selected.
<p>
Click Side buttons to set the joint side.  Clicking "Guess" will set each joint
to left, right or center based on its X position.
<p>
Tip: Pick walking can be used to quickly move between joints and label them.
Select both collar joints and click Collar.  Then simply press down to move
down to the two shoulder joints and click Shoulder.  Repeat for the elbow and
hand.
