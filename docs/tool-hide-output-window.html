<h1>Window &gt; Hide Output Window</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This hides the Maya output window, which isn't useful to most users and causes
clutter when several instances of Maya are open.
<p>
This is only available on Windows.

<h2>Usage</h2>

To hide the Maya output window, select <b>Windows &gt; Hide Output Window</b>.
This will be saved and the output window will be hidden automatically.
<p>
To show the output window again, select <b>Windows &gt; Show Output Window</b>.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        The output window can't be completely hidden, since Maya will un-hide it each time
        it outputs anything to it.  To work around this, the window is removed from
        alt-tab and taskbar list.  This means the window may be visible underneath other
        windows.
    </li>
</ul>
