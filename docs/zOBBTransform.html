<h1>zOBBTransform</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Extract translation, rotation and scale changes from a mesh.
<p>
This plugin connects to an original mesh and a changed mesh, and outputs TRS attributes
that approximate the transform being applied to the changed mesh compared to the original
mesh by comparing their OBBs.  This gives a transform that can be used to follow a mesh
around as it's deformed.
<p>
Geometry constraints only stick a transform to a point; this will approximate rotation
and scale as well.
<p>
The input and target mesh must have the same number of vertices.  Input meshes may come
through a groupParts to examine only a small subset of a mesh.
<p>
This currently has a native component to perform the OBB calculation.  This is not
a performance-critical part of the code since it's only performed on a 3x3 matrix,
and this dependency could be eliminated with something like this:

<p>
Conversely, this is fairly slow due to manipulating vertex data in Python.  Doing that
part in native code would be a lot faster.
