<h1>zChooser</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a small helper node to select one output out of several.  This can be implemented
with native Maya nodes, and this is only a shortcut to allow selecting any number of outputs
with just one node.

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
    <b>choice</b> - The element of output[] that should be set to <b>selectedValue</b>.
</li>
<li>
    <b>selectedValue</b> - The value to set the selected element to.
</li>
<li>
    <b>unselectedValue</b> - The value to set all other elements to.
</li>
<li>
    <b>output[]</b> - An array of output values.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>

To display one out of a list of ten meshes, connect each transform's visibility attribute
to an element of output.  Leave selectedValue and unselectedValue at their defaults of 1 and 0,
and set choice to the index of the mesh to display.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

This doesn't work for texture attributes.  A Python implementation would probably be too slow
for that anyway.

<h2>Notes</h2>

There must be a builtin node that does this.  "chooser" looks close, but isn't quite it.
