<h1>Deform &gt; Copy Weights...</h1>

Copy weights from one deformer to another, or from one blend shape target to another.
<p>
This is like Copy Skin Weights for deformer and blend shape weights.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Select a mesh and activate Copy Weights.
<p>
Select the source and destination deformers to copy.
<p>
If a blendShape is selected, you can select the blend shape target's weights to
copy, or "Main deformer weights" to copy the main deformer weights.
<p>
If both the source and destination deformers are blendShapes, you can select
"All (match by name)" in the source blend shape target, and all blend shape
targets with matching names will have their weights copied.  The deformer
weights will also be copied.  If this is selected, the blend shape target in
the target deformer will be greyed out.
<p>
If more than one mesh is affected by either deformer, select which one to copy
from the Shape dropdowns.
<p>
Click Apply.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Only simple world space position matching is supported.</li>
    <li>Only deformed meshes are supported, and not curves or NURBS surfaces.</li>
</ul>
