<h1>Skin &gt; Create Editable Joints</h1>
<p>
Create a helper skeleton that can be used to adjust the position of skinned joints.
<p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Create Editable Joints creates a proxy skeleton that can be used to edit bound
joints.
<p>
The edit skeleton can be moved and rotated, like editing a skeleton in Move Skinned
Joints mode.  However, the bind skeleton can be freely posed while doing this, to
quickly see the results of adjusting joints.
<p>
When finished editing, just delete the editable joints.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Before starting, ensure that all joints have zeroed rotations.  The bind rotations
should be frozen to joint orient.
<p>
Select one or more joints, and <b>Skin &gt; Create Editable Joints</b> from the Rigging menu set.

<h2>Notes</h2>
If a joint's translation is constrainted, the edit joint's translation will be
locked.
<p>
It's useful to enable Preserve Children on manipulators to move a joint but leave
its child joints in place.
