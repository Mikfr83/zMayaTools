zMouthController is a control rig for keyframing simple mouth animations.  It
focuses on having a small number of simple controls, and is intended for simple
cartoon animations.  (It isn't suitable for realistically styled animations.)
<p>
This controls a list of blend shape targets.  Any number of blend shapes can
be controlled, with up to two active at any given time.  Regardless of how
many blend shapes are available, only four attributes need to be keyframed:
an attribute to select each of the two active blend shapes, one attribute to
blend between those two blend shapes, and an attribute to enable the combination.
<p>
Blend shapes can be added without affecting existing scenes, and without adding
any extra nodes to the scene.
<h2>Usage</h2>

Create a zMouthController node.  Connect blend shape weights to the output[] array
in the node editor.
<p>
Open the keying interface with <code>Skeleton &gt; Mouth Controller</code>.

<h2>UI</h2>

<table class="ui-table">
    <tr>
        <td>1 - Node selection</td>
        <td>Choose the zMouthController node to edit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2 - Select node</td>
        <td>Select the node chosen in the node dropdown.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3 - Weighting display</td>
        <td>
            This gives a quick visualization of which shape is active.
            <p>
            Green indicates that the shape is selected, and black indicates that the shape is deselected.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4 - Solo</td>
        <td>
            Solo the selected shape.  This allows quickly selecting a shape without modifying
            the weights.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>5 - Key shape selection</td>
        <td>Set a keyframe for the shape selection.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>6 - Choose shape</td>
        <td>Select the blend shape to use in each slot.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>7 - Blend between shapes</td>
        <td>
            Select which of the two shapes is active.
            <p>
            When this bar is on the left, the first shape is active.  When it's on the
            right, the second shape is active.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>8 - Key shape blending</td>
        <td>Set a keyframe for shape blending.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>9 - Mouth open/close weight</td>
        <td>
            Set how much to activiate the blended shape.
            <p>
            When this bar is on the left, the blend shape is disabled and the base shape
            is displayed.  When it's on the right, the selected blend shapes are fully
            active.
            <p>
            Since the base shape normally has a closed mouth, and the blend shapes open
            the mouth in various ways, this controls how much to open the mouth.

        <td>10 - Key open/close weight</td>
        <td>Set a keyframe for the mouth open/close weight.</td>
