<h1>zRigHandle</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

A shape node for visible, easily selected rig controls.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Create a rig handle with Create &gt; Rig Handle.
<p>
This node can be used in place of shape nodes and nurbs curves for rig controls.
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This control is drawn in X-ray, like HumanIK controls, to make it easy to see
        and select.  This can be turned off in the attribute editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Like HumanIK viewport handles, a solid object is displayed and selectable, so
        you don't have to click on an awkward thin wireframe like with joint controls.
    </li>
    <li>
        The color and opacity of the control in the viewport can be set.  These can be
        keyed, for example to brighten a control as it gets further away from its bind
        position.
    </li>
    <li>
        A separate local transform attribute is provided.  This controls the orientation
        of the control independently from its transform.  For example, you can put an aim
        constraint on a helper node underneath the rig control and connect its local matrix
        to .translate, which will make the displayed control follow the aim constraint without
        affecting its transform.
    </li>
    <li>
        Local transform, rotate and scale attributes allow adjusting the displayed
        control, without affecting objects constrained to it.
    </li>
    <li>
        A custom mesh can be used.  Connect its outMesh to .inCustomMesh, and set the
        shape to "Custom" in the AE.  Only the faces of the mesh will be used, not its
        material, and only tris and quads are supported.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    This is only tested in Viewport 2.0, and isn't expected to work in obsolete viewports.
    </li>
</ul>
