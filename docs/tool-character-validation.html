<h1>Skeleton &gt; Validate Character</h1>

This performs a number of checks on a character model to find common things that can
cause issues.  Detecting these early, before complex rigging is laid on top of a
mesh, can save a lot of work later.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Select one or more mesh.  Select Skeleton &gt; Validate Character and click Apply.
<p>
A window will show the results.  Most messages can be clicked to focus on the
relevant nodes or components.

<h2>Scene requirements</h2>
All joints in the skeleton must have joint labels.  Symmetric joints on the left
and right side must have the same joint type, so they can be matched against each
other.
<p>
Except for symmetry, joint types must be unique.  Rather than setting all fingers
to "Finger", set fingers to "Other" and give them a unique name in "Other Type".
This allows reliably matching joints to each other without any heuristics.
<p>
All joints marked Left or Right are expected to be symmetric, with a matching
joint on the other side.  Joints marked "Center" are expected to be on the YZ
plane.  Asymmetric joints that aren't in the center should have their side set
to None.
<p>
The character must be Y-up, facing positive Z.
<p>
The skeleton should be in bind pose when it's checked.  A number of checks are performed
to find unintentional deviations from the bind pose.

<h2>Mesh validations</h2>

<ul>
<li>Detect nonmanifold vertices, nonmanifold edges and lamina edges.</li>
<li>
    Only one history mesh.  More than one mesh in history often indicates that construction
    history has been left behind unintentionally.
    <p>
    Some rigs may cause false positives.
</li>
<li>
    No vertex tweaks on the output mesh.  This can happen if the output mesh is modified, and
    can result in problems during export.
</li>
<li>
    No vertex tweaks on the mesh or on a tweak node.  These are mostly harmless, but can
    make some operations not work, such as connecting a temporary mesh's outMesh to the inMesh
    of the base mesh to copy data.
</li>
<li>
The current output mesh is identical to the base mesh.  If the mesh isn't identical,
something in the rigging is changing it.  Most character meshes should be identical to
their base mesh when in bind pose.  (However, things like IK and HumanIK can cause this
to not happen.)
</li>
<li>
Meshes are topologically symmetric around edges on the YZ plane.  This is tested
by attempting to activate topological symmetry (there's no API exposed for this).
</li>
<li>Mesh vertices are symmetric in world space across the YZ plane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skeleton validations</h2>

If the mesh has a skeleton, these checks are performed.  Note that most checks are
only performed on joints that are bound to the selected mesh, and helper joints in
the skeleton that aren't bound are ignored.

<ul>
<li>
    The current pose of the skeleton matches the pose the skeleton was in at bind time.
    This doesn't depend on a bindPose node.
</li>
<li>The geometry transform matches what it was at bind time.</li>
<li>Stub joints (non-bound leaf joints) have a zero joint orient.  Orient joints tends to
give these a weird orientation.</li>
<li>The rotation of all joints is zero.</li>
<li>
    All joints have labels.
    <p>
    This is very helpful for skin mirroring and copying, and is used for symmetry checks.
</li>
<li>
    Except for left/right symmetric joints, labels aren't duplicated.  Maya may be able
    to figure out duplicated joints based on the hierarchy, but that logic isn't exposed to
    us, so we require unique labels.  For things like finger joints where Maya doesn't provide
    enough labels, use "Other" and set the label directly.
</li>
<li>
    Joints labelled left/right have a matching labelled joint on the other side.  Joints
    labeleld "center" are at X = 0.  If you have joints that are asymmetric (no matching joint
    and also not in the center), set them to side "None".
</li>
<li>Symmetric joints have symmetric positions and rotations, and have the same rotateOrder.</li>
<li>
    Vertices aren't weighted to more than 4 vertices.  This threshold can be changed in options.
    Set this to 0 to disable this check.
</li>
</ul>
