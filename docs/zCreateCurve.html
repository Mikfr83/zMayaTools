    Create &gt; Curve Tools &gt; Curve From Transforms
    <br>
    <span class=header-module>Module: <span class=module>zCreateCurve.mll</span></span>
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

zCreateCurve creates a curve from a list of transforms.
<p>
This gives an easier way to control curves for rigging than approaches like cluster
deformers and skin clusters.
<p>
This is implemented as a native plugin for performance.

<h2>Usage</h2>

Load the zCreateCurve.mll plugin and select
<b>Create &gt; Curve Tools &gt; Create Curve</b>.
<p>
Create and select three or more locators (or other transforms).
<p>
In the Create Curve panel, click <b>Create Curve</b> or drag the locators
into the window.  A curve will be created, using the locator positions as CVs.  If
the curves are moved, the curve will update to follow.
<p>
MMB-drag transforms in the list to change the order.
<p>
Click <b>Select Node</b> to view the zCreateCurve node and adjust the
settings of the curve.
<p>
Double-click a transform to quickly select it.
<p>
The same transform can be listed more than once.  Inserting the same transform
more than once is a way to increase the influence of a particular CV.

<h2>Attributes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Curve Degree</b> - The degree of the generated curves.  Higher degrees will
        be smoother, and lower degrees will follow the transforms more closely.
        A degree of 1 will generate lines.
        <p>
        Note that this is limited by the number of transforms attached to the curve.
        If the degree is too high, it will be reduced to a valid value automatically.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Periodic Curve</b> - If true, generate a periodic (looping) curve.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Parameter Range</b> - The parameter range for the generated curves.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>EP Curve</b> - If set, the transforms will be used as edit points instead
        of CVs.  This is the same as creating a curve with the EP Curve tool.  Note
        that EP curves have several limitations (see below).
        <p>
        EP curves reach the transforms exactly, rather than using them as targets.
        They may be useful for some cases, but can give less controllable results.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>UI</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Create Node</b> - Create a new zCreateCurve node.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Delete Node</b> - Delete the current zCreateCurve node.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Select Node</b> - Select the current zCreateCurve node.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

EP curves don't support parameterRange and will always have a parameter range of 1.
<br>
EP curves don't work for all degrees, and degree 3 is recommended.
